WolfEdit 2 SourceHere is the full Think Pascal 4 source code for WolfEdit 2.Two project files are included, WolfEdit.¹ with debugging turned on, and WolfEdit.Build.¹ with debugging off for building a final application.The Goof folder contains a version of Greg's Object Oriented Framework, a GUI library used by WolfEdit.The Wolf FKEY folder contains the patch for creating 1st/2nd Encounter scenarios, and the source for the Wolf FKEY code resource and the Wolf FKEY Installer application.The WolfMap Ä and WolfArt Ä folders contain the source of two auxiliary applications that I used during the development of WolfEdit. They are not part of WolfEdit itself.Have fun,Greg Ewinggreg@cosc.canterbury.ac.nzhttp://www.cosc.canterbury.ac.nz/~greg
